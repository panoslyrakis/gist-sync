npm install @mui/material
Also add the following requirements (mui docs don't include that... at least atthe time of writting this)
npm install @emotion/react
npm install @emotion/styled


//Also npm install @material-ui/icons to install the icons package to the package.json dependencies.
For mui 5 :
npm install @mui/icons-material


For the code editor we use ace (https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace/tree/master):
npm install react-ace ace-builds


For the react code editor we use Monaco for react (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react#installation) because it has the clearest documentation:
npm install @monaco-editor/react


Uses axios too. To install it:
npm install axios --save-dev
Saved it as a dev dependency
